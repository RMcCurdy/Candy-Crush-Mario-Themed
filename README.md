# Candy-Crush-Mario-Themed
Python Project in 2018 that is a remake of the Candy Crush game with a Mario Theme.
The files seen above are very messy and unorganized. This is due to the fact that this was one of the project I did during my first few months of programming, so the practices used are not optimal.
